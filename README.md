## Purpose 
This allows coding boot camp students to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that they can gauge on their progress compared to their peers.

## Description
The student will take a code quiz. First the student will begin with clicking the start button and a timer starts and a question is display. When the student answers a question then they are presented with another question. If the student answers a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock. When the student completes all of the questions or all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the Quiz is over. The student is then able to enter their initials and save their score.
